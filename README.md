# Project 23 - Swifty Ninja

Days 77-79 of 100 Days Of Swift

https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100

## Topics

Day 77: SKShapeNode, touchesEnded(), AVAudioPlayer, CGPath, and UIBezierPath.

Day 78: CaseIterable, GCD, and SKTexture.

## Challenges

Day 79:

1. Try removing the magic numbers in the createEnemy() method. Instead, define them as constant properties of your class, giving them useful names.
2. Create a new, fast-moving type of enemy that awards the player bonus points if they hit it.
3. Add a “Game over” sprite node to the game scene when the player loses all their lives.
